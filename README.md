## Abstract
With significant talk over weather or not standardizeded tests should be used, and if they are only measuring underlying variables. I wanted to create something that would enable people to understand how non-standardized test factors are related to graduation rate in order to build a greater undertanding of the scope of improvements that need to be made for graduation rates to improve outside of "people need to do better on tests" as wishes without direction are unhelpful. In order to build such understanding I aggregated data from NYC Open data sets of non-test factors from 2016-2019, and used this data to build a model that could predict weather a school was at or above the 90% graduation rate goal, and then built an interactive quiz and supporting visualizations with the aim of enableing readers to think about themselves and the factors that effect education more critically.
